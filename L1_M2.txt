---->Containers, - 3 
---->Execute SQL Task, 
---->Script Component: Apply multiple transformations to data instead of using multiple transformations in the data flow.
                  For example, a script can add the values in two columns and then calculate the average of the sum.
---->Script task, 
---->FTP task: Copying directories and data files from one directory to another, before or after moving data,
          and applying transformations to the data. 
---->Bulk insert task,
---->Expression task,
---->checkpoints in SSIS, :When a package fails, the Checkpoint file remains on disk 
                      and can be used the next time the package is executed to restore the values of package variables 
                      and restart at the point of failure
---->Execute Package task,
---->Data profiling task, 
---->File system task,
---->Aggregate, Conditional split, 
---->data conversion,
---->Look up,
---->Merge, 
---->Multicast,
---->OLE DB Command, 
---->Row count, 
---->SCD, 
---->Sort, 
---->Union all,
---->Audit, 
---->cache,
---->Character Map, 
---->Copy column, 
---->Fuzzy grouping and fuzzy Lookup, 
---->import column, both sampling, pivot

----> fuzzy lookup
----> unique values : sorting 
----> Types of cache used


slowly changing Dimension:

Type 1: updation in done(if no history is required) 

primay key in source table can never be used as seroagate key in Dimension Table

* Type 2: new row is added with history 
Type 3: partial history is maintained (current and present)

----> package deployement and project deployement are available in ssis
----> check points different values never,ifexist,always
----> etl tools: informatica,talend,ssis
----> max concurrent executables in ssis : -1
----> merging : yes
---->  diff bw merge nad merge join
----> evaluating and doing transformations (yes) using data conversions
----> conditional split
----> multicast 




----> OLTP denormalized,data warehouse,
---->  Conceptual,physical,logical data modelling
---->  simple in OLTP , complex in OLAP
---->  lookup into flatfile : By using cache
---->  if package fails : 3types 
                         1.constraint
---->  single and cross filter in power bi
---->  hirarchies are done in report view
----> many to many is not supported in power bi
---->  types of filters : page level,report level
----> report sharing after publishing 
---->  if u click on the dash borad a report then it redirects to report from where it came.
---->  bypass prepare in OLEDB comand 
---->  options for checkpoint : never, always
---->  bulk insert task : text file, we cannot perform transformations into it.
---->  FTP task , execute process task
---->  how to change the date and time into the respective region in power BI
---->  merge(types of joins)  and append
---->  split by coloumn : delimiter and number of characters
---->  At each occurence, by using delimiter results into more than one column
---->  Creating a relationship or no relationship bw tables which leads the coloumn table of incorrect data( it show right data even though it is wrong)
----> Parameters in power BI 

----> ".pbit" is the extension of template or parameter which we load
----> Types of containers
----> import, Direct query
----> if there are null values we perform fill operation above or below
----> Shcedule refresh
----> instead of sort, aggregate transformation is performed (inorder to remove duplicates)
